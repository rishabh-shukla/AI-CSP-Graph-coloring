# AI-CSP-Graph-coloring
Artificial Intelligence Project

To find a suitable assignment of colours to the cities on a map with given number of colours using the following algorithms and comparing the time.

Following algorithms have been applied.
1. Backtrack search 
2. Backtrack with forward checking search 
3. Backtrack with MAC search 
4. Local Search - Min Conflicts 

Finding a suitable assignment means that no two cities which are adjacent should be assigned the same colour.
